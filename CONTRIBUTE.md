# Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute to this project, there are many ways to do so:

## Easy ways to contribute

Here are a few ideas for how you can contribute, even if you are new to compilers, Fortran, git, or Perl:

- Test the compiler with Fortran code you're using and let me know any issues.
- Make GitHub issues and contribute to the conversations about how to resolve them.
- Read issues and pull requests that other people created and contribute to the conversation about how to resolve them. Look for issues tagged with good first issue, easy, or help wanted.
- Improve the documentation and the unit tests.

- Tell your friends and colleagues about the Glasgow Fortran Source-to-Source Compiler.

## How to contribute to the code

Contributors to the Glasgow Fortran Source-to-Source Compiler use GitHub’s pull requests to add/modify its source code. Here’s an outline of the process:

- Create a GitHub issue and get initial feedback from users and maintainers. If the issue is a bug report, please include the code needed to reproduce the problem.
- Obtain the latest version of the code: Fork the RefactorF4Acc project to your GitHub account, git clone your fork to your computer.
- Make some or all of your changes/additions and git commit them to your local repository.
- Share your changes with us via a pull request: git push your local changes to your GitHub fork, then go to GitHub make a pull request.

Also see GitHub’s Set Up Git and Using Pull Requests.

For developing, you will need Perl v5.10 or later installed. If you want to contribute, please open a pull request, preferably one that addresses a known issue.

You must include documentation and tests for any new or improved code. We can provide help and advice on this after you start the pull request.
