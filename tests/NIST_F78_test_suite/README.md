### To run the NIST test suite

We use the [NIST FORTRAN78 test suite](ftp://ftp.fortran-2000.com/fcvs21_f95.tar.bz2) for validation. The original F77 files are in `fcvs21_f95`. There are a few small changes compared to the original test suite:ยง

      - The file `FM046.f` contains a change to TEST 759: the original test (`FM045.f`) has 57 nested parentheses, this was changed to 5 nested parentheses because the current expression parser takes too long to parse this.
      - The file `FM090.f` is a modified version of `FM010.f` without spaces in types, variable names, values and labels.
      - The file `FM091.f` is a modified version of `FM011.f` without spaces in types, variable names, values and labels.
      - The file `FM500.f` contains tests for corner cases of COMMON blocks and BLOCK DATA (37+16 tests) which we don't support.
      - The file `FM509.f` is skipped as it no longer compiles.

In the folder `fcvs21_f95`, there are two subfolders `Test_rf4a` and  `RefactoredSources`. To verify the original test suite you can use the script `driver_parse`; to run it you can use the script `driver_run`; you may have to change the name of the Fortran compiler in `FC` at the start of these scripts.

The refactored Fortran-95 code is generated in the folder `RefactoredSources`. There are three scripts in this folder, `driver_parse`, `driver_run` and `driver_run_single`. You may have to change the name of the Fortran compiler in `FC` at the start of these scripts. Please ensure that the environment varianble `$FC` is set to the Fortran compiler you want to use. I have tested the code only with `gfortran 9.4` on Linux and `gfortran 13.1` on MacOS.


To generate the refactored Fortran-95 code for the test suite, build and run it, do:

      $ cd fcvs21_f95/Test_rf4a
      $ ./generate_and_run.sh

Generating, compiling and running the test suites takes a few minutes.

The final output should look like:

      user	0m52.830s
      sys	0m7.598s

With the current version (6.1.0), the failing tests are:

FM406 test 3,
FM923 tests 22 and 23, 
FM302 tests 4 and 14

These tests also fail in the original code with gfortran.

The other failing is FM302 test 13

      C     ****  FCVS PROGRAM 302  -  TEST 013  ****                      
      C                                                                    
      C          TEST 013 IS DESIGNED TO TEST THE EXTENSION OF NAMED COMMON
      C     BLOCK STORAGE BY EQUIVALENCE ASSOCIATION OF A VARIABLE AND AN  
      C     ARRAY.                                                         

This behaviour can't be made type safe, so I am not supporting it.
