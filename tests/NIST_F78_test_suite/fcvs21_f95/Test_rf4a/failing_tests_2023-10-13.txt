With the current version (1.1.0), the failing tests are 
FM406 test 3
FM923 tests 22 and 23, these tests also fail in the original code with gfortran.
The other failing test is 
FM308 test 57, this is because the current version does not refactor common blocks in functions, only in subroutines.

New failures:
FM300.res:                        1 TESTS FAILED
I think this is because if we have 
EQUIVALENCE(IVOE19,IVOE20)
DATA IVOE19 / 19 /

then we should have

IVOE20 = IVOE19 

inserted after that, because that is like an assignment


FM302.res:                        3 TESTS FAILED

The original version, compiled with gfortran 9, has 2 failed tests, 4 and 14; the refactored version also fails test 13
