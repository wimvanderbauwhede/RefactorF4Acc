what we need to do is
- check if the subroutine is part of a module => via 'InModule'/'InModule_Blocks' 
- if so, 
    - is the var defined at module level? We have 'Container', 'Container_Blocks' and 'ParametersFromContainer', which is only used in Refactoring::Common
    - What we don't seem to have is 'VarsFromContainer'; or yes, we have it in State, but it is not populated.
    - if not, does the module have Use statements? If so, these should be added to the Use statements of the subroutine.
    - e have 'UsedParameters', 'UsedGlobalVars' and 'UsedLocalVars' for every subroutine. So it seems to me that in principle, we should not have this problem
    - we also have $stref->{'UsedModules'}, which has all used modules, but it's only populated in Modules::add_module_decls
    - but we have $stref->{'dModules'}, which has all modules reached in the recdescent
    and $Sf->{'Uses'}, which has the modules used by that unit (but not via the container)
    - So I guess I should add 'UsesViaContainer'
    - And I also need the transitive closure, so say 'UsesTransitively' 

In terms of refactoring, what we need is to detect that a variable used in a subroutine is declared in an enclosing or used module.

The question is, given a variable in a subroutine, when should this become an argument?
