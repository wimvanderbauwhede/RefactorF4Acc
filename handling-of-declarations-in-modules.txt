what we need to do is
- check if the subroutine is part of a module => via InModule/InModules but the use of InModules is not clear, it is only defined when extracting blocks
- if so, 
    - is the var defined at module level? We have Container, Container (only used when extracting blocks) and ParametersFromContainer, which is only used in Refactoring::Common
    - What we don't seem to have is VarsFromContainer
    - if not, does the module have Use statements? If so, these should be added to the Use statements of the subroutine.
    - We have UsedParameters, UsedGlobalVars and UsedLocalVars for every subroutine. So it seems to me that in principle, we should not have this problem
    - we also have $stref->{'UsedModules'}
