This folder (`TestHarnessBinaries`) contains the binaries for the test harnesses used to test your code. To run the tests, you need to link the provided binaries with the binaries of your code.

1/ These binaries were compiled on the L4 lab machines, so they may not work anywhere else, and you may need to install `regex-tdfa` using `cabal`.

2/ Compile _your_ code in its source folder (i.e. _not_ in the folder `TestHarnessBinaries`)

3/ copy all `.o` and `.hi` files resulting from compilation of your code into `TestHarnessBinaries`

    $ cd TestHarnessBinaries
    $ cp <path to your code>/*.hi .
    $ cp <path to your code>/*.o .

For reference, that should be the following `.o` files

    EvalExpr.o
    F95OpenACCParser.o
    F95ParDecl.o
    F95SrcIO.o
    F95SubDecl.o
    F95Types.o
    F95VarDecl.o
    F95VarDeclParser.o
    OpenCLAPIGenerator.o

and the corresponding `.hi` files.  

4/ Run the link script for each test in the `tbin` folder. For example, to link `test_F95SrcIO`:

    $ cd tbin
    $ ./link_test_F95SrcIO.sh

5/ Run the tests, e.g. for `test_F95SrcIO`

    $ ./test_F95SrcIO

6/ The test `test_Main` requires the output generated by your `Main` program, in `TestHarnessBinaries` with the _exact_ name `module_LES_ocl.f95`, and the reference output in `TestHarnessBinaries/tbin` with the _exact_ name `module_LES_ocl_REF.f95`.

These binaries are provided as a courtesy and I will not provide any additional explanations about their use or the output they produce. of the files in this folder.
