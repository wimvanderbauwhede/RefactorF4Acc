Then we look at all fold kernels. For these, we make another dependency list. 
What we want to do is find the folds that do not depend on folds; then the folds that depend on these; etc.

I can do this elegantly, or brute force, it does not really matter I think.

"elegantly" is probably:

* Find an input node (or edge)
* for every input, follow it (rec descent) until you hit the first fold but not further. 
Store that fold (and the paths?)

Then prune everything leading up to each of these, so the fold outputs will be the new inputs. 

Then repeat the algorithm, and do this until there are no folds left.

The result is the stages: each stage is a set of folds. 
Their dependencies are already known from the first stage. 
When we run such a stage, we need to store the outputs of the folds and use them as inputs for the next stage. 
So the pruned graphs are the stages.

----

When we've finally collected all kernels for all stages, what we need to do is 
annotate the inputs and outputs with the stages in which they should resp. read and write.
I think this only really matters for the outputs
So for every output we need to check if it is connected to a mode in the set for a given stage.
I fnot, it should not be written to. 
The annotation is simply the set of stages where it is OK to write.

----
I realise I alos need the StencilDef nodes in Nodes, just so that at the end we can include them via EntryID
