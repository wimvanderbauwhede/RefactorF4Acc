# Versioning Conventions

* Versions only apply to the master branch

* All versions have a corresponding tag

* The version number reflects the release date:

- 1.1.0: 1 Nov 2018
- Major version increments each year
- Minor version increments each quarter, i.e. if it's 3 months after the previous release, +1 
- Patch version increments inside a quarter, ad-hoc
