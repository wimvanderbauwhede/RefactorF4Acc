Somehow, what should be an embedded constant becomes a regular constant. 
The bug is in calcByteHexConst, but really it is that we should emit gte instead of gte2

;calcByteHexConst_hinibc LDA #30  gte2 ;calcByteHexConst_hinibc LDA #39  lte2  AND ;&b3 JCN2


Another bug: if we print an array slice, whatever comes before is not printed
