So the main points to formalise:

a pure function is

f :: t_1 -> ... -> t_i -> ... -> t_n -> t_r

where t_r in general could be (t_{r,1}, ..., t_{r,i}, ..., t_{r,m})

a fortran subroutine can be translated into a pure function as follows: 
- infer the intent (!)
- every InOut becomes an (In,Out) tuple
- every read is from the In, every write is to the Out; 

T, intent(InOut) :: a

(a, ...,l_{i},...) = exp(a, ...,l_{i},...)

T, intent(In) :: a_{in}
T, intent(Out) :: a_{out}

=> 

a = a_{in}

(a, ...,l_{i},...) = exp(a, ...,l_{i},...)

a_{out} = a

[[
Or else:

a = a_{in}
call f(a)
a_{out} = a
]]

The typing rule for a pure function is simply

e1: tau1 s : tau1 -> tau2
--------------------------
call s(e1) :: tau2

where tau1 is type consisting of the the tuple of all input types, tau2 is type consisting of the the tuple of all output types.

Function Declaration Typing

Do I need this? because there is fundamentally no difference in the body

subdecl ::= subroutine id_s ( ...,id_in,i : τ_in,i,... ) : (...,id_out,i : τ_out,i, ...) = [exp_1, ...]

where
	exp_i :: = (id_{j}, ...,l_{i},...) = exp(id_{j}, ...,l_{i},...)

G [id2 : τ1] |-- exp : τ2
----------------------------------------------------------
G |-- (subroutine id_s ( id_1 : τ_1, ... ) : τ_r = exp) ok



Program Typing

contextof(decl1 ... decln) = G

G |-- decl1 ok   ...  G |-- decln ok

----------------------------------------------------

|-- decl1 ... decln ok


The judgment (G |-- exp : τ) states that expression exp has type τ in context G. A context G is a finite partial map from identifiers to types. The context "nil" is the empty context. The context G [x : τ] is the same as G except it maps identifier x to τ. The following rules define the expression typing judgement.

-------


Now the big question is: given

common id_1 : tau_1, ...
-- G: all values for id_i in the common block
subroutine id_s () : () 
  common id_{s,1} : tau_{s,1}, ...
  
end subroutine

How can we prove that this is the same as 


call id_s' (id_i | id_s,i in G_s)


-- G: all updated values for id_i in the common block

G: all types for id_i in the common block, G_s: all types for id_s,i in the common block , 
#{tau_i}>= #{tau_s,i}
forall i in , tau_i == tau_s,i => OK, and not just OK but we can type the subroutine as above

----

So at  first, we will assume that an array T, dimension(i,j,...) :: a
is a collection of scalars and that
a(i,j,k) is syntactic sugar for a_ijk. So all arguments can in principle be scalars (in practice of course not)

Then we revisit this and present an algorithm to map this, including reshaping.

a_{i,s}(j) = a_i,j+k or something

-----

Now let's have a look at what we have:

1/ "Do they align?" i,e, 
#{tau_i}>= #{tau_s,i}
forall i, tau_i == tau_s,i and id_i == id_s,i

If they do, the conversion is trivial

2/ If not:

I need to explain about how the arrays can overlap:

xxxxyzzz
uvxxxx--

uvxxxx--
xxxxyzzz

For simplicity I will assume we always prefix the names from local in caller

====
In terms of structure of the paper:

* Fortran still matters
* Acceleration by offloading matters
* Therefore we need self-contained ("pure") functions

* Related work: see earlier paper, be nice to CamFort

* Preliminaries
- full explicit typing and type checking (algo)
- intent inference (algo)
- some discussion on F77 type safety, i.e. F77 warns but errors are blanket
- I need some discussion on EQUIVALENCE too to justify expected behaviour
